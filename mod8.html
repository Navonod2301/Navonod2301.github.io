    <h1>Animating MagicaVoxel Characters</h1>

    <p>
      Today we made characters in MagicaVoxel and gave them animations in mixamo, then put them into playcanvas to place in a plane for animating larger projects. Pictured above is one of my characters in MagicaVoxel. The pair of assets doing looping animations are the end product of this.

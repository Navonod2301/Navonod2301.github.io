      For this module we followed freecodecamp through the first tutorial. It taught some basics of HTML by having you follow 
      its instructions while coding a website. It was easy to grasp and the explanations really helped me understand what it 
      was teaching. Pictured above is the final product and <a href="code/freecodecamp.html">Here</a> is the code for it.

    For Module 3, I started messing with the code in the game engine I found. I changed the names of files and the names of the folders they were in.
    This created a couple of problems, mainly the main.html not being able to find files with the old names. I had to change the names of the files 
    there as well, pictured below. Another problem I dealt with broke the game itself so after trying to figure it out for about twenty minutes, I
    remembered that I could use the inspect tool and found the problem very quickly and fixed it.
    <a href='code/character.js' target='_blank' >Here</a> is the character.js file,
    <a href='code/code.js' target='_blank' >This</a> is the code.js file,
    <a href='code/maps.js' target='_blank' >This</a> is the maps.js file, and
    <a href='code/engine.js' target='_blank' >Here</a> is the engine.js file.

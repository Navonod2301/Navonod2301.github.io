    For Module 3, I started messing with the code in the game engine I found. I changed the names of files and the names of the folders they were in. This created a couple of problems, mainly the main.html not being able to find files with the old names. I had to change the names of the files there as well, pictured below. Another problem I dealt with broke the game itself so after trying to figure it out for about twenty minutes, I remembered that I could use the inspect tool and found the problem very quickly and fixed it.
